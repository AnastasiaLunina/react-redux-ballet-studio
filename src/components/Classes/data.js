      title: "Contemporary for teens",
      description: "Unlike traditional forms of dance, contemporary is considered to be somewhat unbound by much rigidity and rules. The dancers of this genre have the ability to transform a performance based on their own interpretations. This is achieved through honing in on certain techniques, such as focusing on strong ballet-influenced leg movements, fall and recovery, floor work and further improvisational elements. More frequently than not, contemporary dance is performed barefoot to allow for more fluidity in movement and connection to the dance surface.",

      description: "Barre classes combine low-impact exercises like stretching or upper arm circles with faster-paced physical activity such as jumping squats to create a variety of aerobic conditioning sessions which has been shown over time are more effective at improving core strength than traditional sit-ups can offer alone.  Barres provides coordination training by requiring participants to keep both eyes open while simultaneously moving their heads from side to face forward back around again then switching sides before repeating.",
